# Meteora-python
My very first python pygame. It's simple, but at least is something.

You can extend the game, add things, delete things, idk, do whatever you want with it. The game is a simple block trying to evade other blocks that fall from the heavens while conveniently picking up ammo and shield to defend yourself... your typical side scroller shooter.

I apoligize for the messy code, I'm still a novice programmer and have a lot to learn, specially in terms of architecture.

Anyway, enjoy!
